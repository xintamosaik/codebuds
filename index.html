        <p>Digital Gaming has become quite the part in present culture. Also, digital games, digital gaming and 
          its culture has evolved a lot since Spacewar saw the day of light in 1962
          <a href='#juul2001' class='onsite'>(JUUL 2001)</a>.
          At the time of writing spring 2021 digital games are nearly everywhere. 
          Computers are everywhere and where Computers are, there are digital games.
          Hi! I am {{{author}}} and I am studying sociology in Germany. 
          For my master thesis, I want to find out what gamers actually do,
          when they play games like Skyrim (BETHESDA 2011). After reviewing journalist reports,
          scientic articles and some popular book reviews on the topic, it became clear,
          almost no one asks that question. If it is asked, the question most of the time is already
          loaded with a limited set of initerests, agendas and or (scientific methods).
          While recently more researchers and journalists started to invest time to find out
          how players identify with their avatar (CITATION NEEDED), how gender comes into play (CITATION NEEDED) 
          or how gaming can help to cope with (mental)(CITATION NEEDED) issues 
          (<a href="#newman2008" class='onsite'>NEWMAN 2008 : 1</a>)</cite>,
          a lot of mainstream media and research still center around gaming potentially threatening health (CITATION NEEDED).
          Inside the community discourse on gaming has entirely different sujets of course. 
          And this is not only discussions between players, but vast fields of journalists, academic writers, 
          PR and PA staff, 
          game developers, content creators in and around the industry, the last mentioned outgrowing 
          their role as mere players
          on platforms like youtube and twitch.tv.  
        </p>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>With all these individuals and interest groups debating, knowledge about what players do seems to be fragmented. 
          While the industry has quite the knowlege how players spend their money for and in games, 
          psychology a very differentiated perspective on the relation between games an violence or 
          game designers a lot of insight what makes games fund and how they can be created efficiently,
          only players for themselves might answer how exactly they play a game. 
          And even they do not know, because they do not think about playing games. They play them.</p>

        <blockquote cite="Newman 2008">
          <p>Videogame players will know well that to fully understand videogaming,
            one needs to appreciate non only what the game is as a formal structure or 
            mechanism but also what happens to it, what can be made with it, in the playing -
            how it is made real, transformed, used and abused.  
            <cite>(<a href="#newman2008" class='onsite'>NEWMAN 2008 : 12</a>)</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I want to draw attention to a detail in Newmans statement. 
          It's the passive form of his questions, that brush the player under the rug
          so to speak. There are no players here. It's about potential of transformation.
          It then can only be about the use and abuse of video games with games and fan art
          and similar byproducts at the center of attention. Player still do not play a big
          role in such a premise.</p>

        <blockquote cite="Newman 2008">
          <p>As such [..] is certainly an important element in the picture
          we should paint in game studies, it is only one element. 
          As Crawford and Rutter (2007) and Jenkins (1993) intimate,
          the investigation of the cultures of play and gaming
          is another potential string to the bow of game studies
          and there is clear room for a more systematic consideration 
          of the situatedness of gameplay and these colllective meanings and practices.
          <cite>(<a href="#newman2008" class='onsite'>NEWMAN 2008 : 13</a>)</cite></p>
        </blockquote>


        <p>When Newman talks about collective meanings and practices there could be room
        for individual practices of playing games. And the next statement underlines how there is 
        a lot of potential for players agency in their actual game sessions</p>

        <blockquote cite="Newman 2008">
          <p>In addition to, and sometimes in place of, playing the game 'as
          intended' or as indicated by the accompanying instruction book or 
          in-game tutorials, players are frequently to be found inventing new
          challenges that reveal not only the plasticity of the game as material for
          play but also for the sophistication of their understanding of the underlying
          rule system and simulation model. [..] The essential premise of this book, then,
          is that videogames provide a complex and varied suite of materials for gamers
          that encourage flexible and creative play, talk, discussion and the prdduction
          of supporting texts that are exchanged and vaulued within the myriad fan communities
          that exist, especially online.
          <cite>(<a href="#newman2008" class='onsite'>NEWMAN 2008 : 14-16</a>)</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>I am almost on the same page as Newman (2008), but I think my understanding of 
          playing games puts players more in a position of using the game as and less of 
          playing the game within its system. The game is not the overarching frame within 
          players play. Again speedruns are a very plastic example. Players do not speedrun 
          while playing a game. They speedrun the game. The objective is to be fast. Every
          game turns into a mere obstacle course, independent of its own design.</p>
        <p>The same can't be said about content creators that play a game ine fashion of 
        the genre Let's Play. They still play the game, but they also have to setup a 
        recording of the session and depending on the targeted audience cater to their needs.
        Since rendered content on youtube is compressed scenes can come out to dark. So 
        content creators could post-process or change contrast settings in-game, but
        they would not do it when playing 'normally.'</p>
        
        <p>I don't think I have my point wtih what has been said. But I will. Soon.</p>

          <h1>Method</h1>
          <p>Actions and their frames will be the focus of videographical analysis.</p>
          <h2>Heuristics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Where does the cursor point and switch to?</li>
            <li>Which keyboard keys have been pressed and what is their function?</li>
            <li>How are both connected to the action and frame?</li>
            <li>What is the situation? What is on the stage? How is that connected?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>What is the overall stage? Are we inside a building? Has the site a
                symbolic or game-relevant meaning?</li>
              <li>What other actors are there? How do they relate? Are they recognized?</li>
              <li>Are there any objects, that are recognized or even used?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>How do UI elements come into play? Is a change in performance visible?
            UI elements might be visible, but players do not notice anymore.
            A good example of obvious attention are weapon stats, when players
            actually compare them.</li>
            <li>What does the game tell itself? Is there more been told? 
              Is a gap visible? How might it be bridged by the player?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Are there any mods that are explaining anything going on?
                How do they support the player expressing themselves?</li>
              <li>Is there a visible performance, that actively brings in narrative?</li>
              <li>Are there any rules visible or known to the researcher by context?
                How might they help exlain the frame or expressive intent of the player? 
                (no fast travel, melee only, knife only)</li>
              <li>What are in-game objectives that are part of the scene? Are there external
                objectives that frame expression or anything in terms of a frame?</li>
              <li>Can we spot projections or reminiscions that exxplain the outset of 
                the scene?</li>
              <li>If players voice their thoughts:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If they adress the world as ..</li>
                <li>If they adress the alternate world ..</li>
                <li>If they adress game element ..</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Mods?</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>About frames</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Viewing the world as a world much like the real world</li>
            <li>Viewing the world as an alternate universe and being open
              to quite different rules (laws of physic, concept of health)</li>
            <li>Viewing the world from a "coders" perspective.</li>
            <li>Viewing the game from a gamers/players perspective. But what
              does that actually mean?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The idea then is to also think of either the avatar and or the player/gamer
          as being constantly in a relation to any or all of these world-views. Through their 
          connection they are able to spin a story they also embody within the frame.
          So it's less a matter of identifying with an avatar but embodying a something in a 
          somewhat. Since the frame might be the game, a certain aspect of the game or 
          a context beyond the game and since the embodiment can happen as player/gamer/avatar
          or even modder/content-creator/speedrunner in these contexts, this all can be
          very elusive. Worse even, players might "dislocate" when feeling ludo-narrative 
          dissonance. But we now kinda hate on that word. The might dislocate on bugs,
          imbalance of game systems, expectations not met, long video/in-game cut-scenes
          Missing choice to express themselves. While it's not yet confirmed within the frame
          of this study, we could later find that a dislocation from avatars might be
          circumevented by players if they switch to a puppet-player role that also can be
          loaded with a narration. Like being a friend to the avatar, that just doesn't
          look similar at all to the player, maybe has a different gender, skin color, or 
          body measures.</p>
        </section>
        <section><p>What and how are they doing what they are doing?
        they play obviously. But waiting, shopping, passengers going, doing learning to play the piano, doing learning to be a boxer
        A playing video games the first time, B playing the genre for the first time. C entering for the first time, D entering later, E playing a 2nd time
        doing learning music, doing learning a different instrument, doing learning a new song..
        This study is not interested in A-C, but more in D-E. and compared to Sudnows (70s)..
        It's about playing a know genre and also not about getting used to basics. 
        It's about players that are already quite skilled and vertraut with the matter, mechanics and sourroundings. 
        The difference between entering later and playing a game 2nd time is important, but a lot of the ongoing interaction does not depend on that. 
        Note to myself? How imprtant is it actually?

        Gopher started his video series on the character Stiv. From the comments of his videos, we know, he already played the game several times before. 
        He says, he wants to to a "focussed run" and be "in character". If we did not hear his comments or read comments on the video we might easily think, the player follows the instructions of the games, it's rules and it's story. 
        But there are actually a lot of moments that show that gophers decisions are in part based on these commitments. 
        Fist, Magic, Heavy Armor, Minions, The mods, College, difficulty, orc, evil
        And then there is actual interaction that supports it. The rider, letting minions attack, testing minions, 

        Before we discuss that we might want to see some different situations in the game, and see what is commonly done and what options gopher choose and could have choosen.
        Combat, Loot, Trade, Walk, Talk, Steal, Follow Quests, Explore, LevelUp.
        The game starts with Character Creation after an introductory in-game cut-scene. Since everyone has to create a character, we could surmise, that there is nothing noticable happening. But that could not be further from my subjective truth.
        In my cursory analysis of 2 players playing Cyberpunk 2077 there was a huge difference in Character Creation. While the first player took over 30 minutes to flesh out the whole design to her liking and making it a bit similar to her own image, the other player just made sure the character did not look too weird and went on in about 3 minutes. 
        When I asked them, the slow player responded that she found it important how to look in the game, even if it was clear to her that she probably wound not touch the game after the short session. The fast player did not find any reason to alter the appearance that much, but found the predefined and random sets a bit too appaling. 
        As we can see, bot players do not just see what the game has in store. Their decisions are based on very different preferences. Since these experimental sessions were observed by me and by the respective partner of the couple that volunteered, I can't be sure if their decision on looks would have been different. That does not make it irrelevant, but it would mean that my obvservation was not of them playing a game but of them playing a game while being observered by their significant other and a third party. It has to be kept in mind.
        The game continues on rails with more in-game cutscene and shortly after handles a part of it's controls to the player. Movement and Camera View.
        This is an interesting scene because the game tries to do a lot to make the player move. People scream, burning debris rains down on the town, the sky is broiling and a dragon sets fire to surrounding people and buildings. In direct view there is one building that looks as if it could protect the player from harm and from within someone is waving at the player to get into the building quickly. 
        But there is no "real" danger even in terms of the gameplay. In playing the game and not following its leads that becomes clear. The dragon will not attack and the burning debris is not damaging the health of the avatar in serious ways. We could stay in the open area for hours. Most players might just run for the door. This is just the opening scene, but there will be several more scenes with added complexity. Players will be able to pick up items, equip weapons, fight, cast spells, level up, hide and sneak, steal and much more in the course of the game. 
        It would be easiest to ignore outliers that ignore the obvious call to run for the door and instead run in the other direction and see if they can climb a broken wall or anything else. A lot of game reviews and game research is more or less dependent on ignoring the outliers to get to conclusions. From these perspectives, the agency of players is reduced to a subset of potential actions very much like any observation that depends on common sense their interpretation of actions or projection onto indivuals thoughts. 
        But we can't find out how people move through streets by only looking at the layout of a street and traffic signs. And even if we find that most people cross the road after looking 2 times for approaching cars, the odd one out that only listens for noises of motors might tell us what we have been missing.</p> </section>
