        <p>Digital Gaming has become quite the part in present culture. Also, digital games, digital gaming and 
          its culture has evolved a lot since Spacewar saw the day of light in 1962
          <a href='#juul2001' class='onsite'>(JUUL 2001)</a>.
          At the time of writing spring 2021 digital games are nearly everywhere. 
          Computers are everywhere and where Computers are, there are digital games.
          Hi! I am {{{author}}} and I am studying sociology in Germany. 
          For my master thesis, I want to find out what gamers actually do,
          when they play games like Skyrim (BETHESDA 2011). After reviewing journalist reports,
          scientic articles and some popular book reviews on the topic, it became clear,
          almost no one asks that question. If it is asked, the question most of the time is already
          loaded with a limited set of initerests, agendas and or (scientific methods).
          While recently more researchers and journalists started to invest time to find out
          how players identify with their avatar (CITATION NEEDED), how gender comes into play (CITATION NEEDED) 
          or how gaming can help to cope with (mental)(CITATION NEEDED) issues 
          (<a href="#newman2008" class='onsite'>NEWMAN 2008 : 1</a>)</cite>,
          a lot of mainstream media and research still center around gaming potentially threatening health (CITATION NEEDED).
          Inside the community discourse on gaming has entirely different sujets of course. 
          And this is not only discussions between players, but vast fields of journalists, academic writers, 
          PR and PA staff, 
          game developers, content creators in and around the industry, the last mentioned outgrowing 
          their role as mere players
          on platforms like youtube and twitch.tv.  
        </p>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>With all these individuals and interest groups debating, knowledge about what players do seems to be fragmented. 
          While the industry has quite the knowlege how players spend their money for and in games, 
          psychology a very differentiated perspective on the relation between games an violence or 
          game designers a lot of insight what makes games fund and how they can be created efficiently,
          only players for themselves might answer how exactly they play a game. 
          And even they do not know, because they do not think about playing games. They play them.</p>

        <blockquote cite="Newman 2008">
          <p>Videogame players will know well that to fully understand videogaming,
            one needs to appreciate non only what the game is as a formal structure or 
            mechanism but also what happens to it, what can be made with it, in the playing -
            how it is made real, transformed, used and abused.  
            <cite>(<a href="#newman2008" class='onsite'>NEWMAN 2008 : 12</a>)</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I want to draw attention to a detail in Newmans statement. 
          It's the passive form of his questions, that brush the player under the rug
          so to speak. There are no players here. It's about potential of transformation.
          It then can only be about the use and abuse of video games with games and fan art
          and similar byproducts at the center of attention. Player still do not play a big
          role in such a premise.</p>

        <blockquote cite="Newman 2008">
          <p>As such [..] is certainly an important element in the picture
          we should paint in game studies, it is only one element. 
          As Crawford and Rutter (2007) and Jenkins (1993) intimate,
          the investigation of the cultures of play and gaming
          is another potential string to the bow of game studies
          and there is clear room for a more systematic consideration 
          of the situatedness of gameplay and these colllective meanings and practices.
          <cite>(<a href="#newman2008" class='onsite'>NEWMAN 2008 : 13</a>)</cite></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>When Newman talks about collective meanings and practices there could be room
        for individual practices of playing games. And the next statement underlines how there is 
        a lot of potential for players agency in their actual game sessions</p>

        <blockquote cite="Newman 2008">
          <p>In addition to, and sometimes in place of, playing the game 'as
          intended' or as indicated by the accompanying instruction book or 
          in-game tutorials, players are frequently to be found inventing new
          challenges that reveal not only the plasticity of the game as material for
          play but also for the sophistication of their understanding of the underlying
          rule system and simulation model. [..] The essential premise of this book, then,
          is that videogames provide a complex and varied suite of materials for gamers
          that encourage flexible and creative play, talk, discussion and the prdduction
          of supporting texts that are exchanged and vaulued within the myriad fan communities
          that exist, especially online.
          <cite>(<a href="#newman2008" class='onsite'>NEWMAN 2008 : 14-16</a>)</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>I am almost on the same page as Newman (2008), but I think my understanding of 
          playing games puts players more in a position of using the game as and less of 
          playing the game within its system. The game is not the overarching frame within 
          players play. Again speedruns are a very plastic example. Players do not speedrun 
          while playing a game. They speedrun the game. The objective is to be fast. Every
          game turns into a mere obstacle course, independent of its own design.</p>
        <p>The same can't be said about content creators that play a game ine fashion of 
        the genre Let's Play. They still play the game, but they also have to setup a 
        recording of the session and depending on the targeted audience cater to their needs.
        Since rendered content on youtube is compressed scenes can come out to dark. So 
        content creators could post-process or change contrast settings in-game, but
        they would not do it when playing 'normally.'</p>
        
        <p>I don't think I have my point wtih what has been said. But I will. Soon.</p>
